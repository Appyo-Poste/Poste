## Developer Documentation - API Config

We used Google Cloud for our API deployment but you may use any service of your choice.

### Step 1 - Create a Project
Follow [this guide](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects) by google to create a new project, I recomend naming it "Poste"

### Step 2 - Enable Access to API
Go to this [link](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/enableflow?apiid=cloudbuild.googleapis.com&_ga=2.24214778.1347067486.1685475824-239984206.1685475824) and select your project that was made in step 1 and follow the prompts to enable API access.
