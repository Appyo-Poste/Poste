You can find the project documentation [here](./docs/home.md)

To get started you will need to [download and setup Android Studio](./docs/devDocs/projectConfig/androidStudio.md) and once that is completed you will need to [host the API](./docs/devDocs/projectConfig/apiConfig.md).

All the API endpoints are documented in the [apiDocs.md](./docs/devDocs/apiDocs.md) file.
